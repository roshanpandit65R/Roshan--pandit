        <p align="center">resource begins with a general<br/> description of essay writing and moves to a discussion of common essay genres 
             may encounter across the curriculum. <b>The four <br/>genres of essays <s>(description, narration, exposition, and argumentation)</s></b> are common
              paper assignments you may encounter in your writing classes. <i>Although these genres, also known as the modes of discourse,
              have been criticized by some composition scholars </i>i the Purdue OWL recognizes the wide spread use of 
            these genres and studentsâ€™ need to understand and produce these types of essays. <u>We hope these resources will help</u>.</p>
